>  Image classification models 
> 
>  Sequence models 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Recommendation systems is the correct answer. But you must understand and know the tools and tricks of image processing and sequence systems to understand recommendation systems.

> Question 3
> 
> What is a key lesson Google has learned with regards to reducing the chance of failure in production ML models?
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  Understand and fully utilize TensorFlow 
> 
>  Base as many models as possible on recommendation systems 
> 

      Process batch data and streaming data the same way 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Make sure batch data and streaming data are processed the same way. If we do this then the training data (batch data) and the streaming data are more likely to be compatible, which improves the chances of a successful serving of the model
